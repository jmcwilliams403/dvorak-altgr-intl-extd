# Dvorak AltGr International Extended
![layout diagram](image.png)

This is a Windows port of the Linux/Unix implementation of Dvorak International, with dead keys moved to the AltGr and AltGr+Shift modifier states.<br>

Liberties taken:<br>
- superscript 1 has swapped positions with inverted exclamation mark
- dead hook has swapped positions with inverted question mark
- the generic currency symbol has swapped positions with the Pound Sterling sign
- dead tilde + `=` now yields `≈`, and the `≃` composition has been moved to dead tilde + `-` per AFNOR NF Z71-300
